# Q. Why offshore solar?
# A. The potential amount of available energy is TREMENDOUS.
Total power generation (per year) is estimated by the product of the three numbers below:
- Yearly direct normal radiation from the Sun (1461 [GWh/km^2])
- Efficiency of solar panels (roughly 10%, actually 15~18%)
- Area of the sea (510,100,000 [km^2])
- How much we cover the sea (just 1%),

which is 1461 [GWh/km^2] * 0.1 * 510,100,000 [km^2] * 0.01 = **745[PWh]** (PWh: Peta Watt hour)

For comparison, total worldwide electricity generation in 2019 was 27[PWh]. Total worldwide energy generation in 2019 was 167[PWh].
